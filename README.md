*Note you must calibrate your machine and have pre-measured optical properties and extinction coefficients of the chromophores of interest for any of these measurements to be valid (e.g.: using intralipid, india ink, and blood. Cramer-Rao lower bound error metrics should be included with these measurements and are available in literature. 
** Note this is just a sample of the code required to interpret frequency modulation in wide-field. 
A microscopic validation using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was on-going...

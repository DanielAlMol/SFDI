*Note you must calibrate your machine and have pre-measured optical properties and extinction coefficients of the chromophores of interest for any of these measurements to be valid. Cramer-Rao lower bound error metrics should be included with these measurements and are available in literature. 
** Note this is just a sample of the code required to interpret frequency modulation in wide-field.
